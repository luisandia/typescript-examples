# Using TypeScript With Next.js

Next.js Version: **8**

This project contains various examples of using types in a Next.js project.
I've made the examples concise (in a cheatsheet form) so they are easy to read and refer to.

In order to run the project please use the following commands:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```
